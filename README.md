# simpleScene
A simple way of making your own level editor in love2d/LÃ–VE and Lua. Loading and saving files is as easy as could be, and you can either 
run it using the included camera system and framework, or roll your own (or use your own favorites). It's easy to extend, and works great
for PSX style games. Including the Square Soft RPG's of the 90's (like Final Fantasy 7, 8, or 9), Lunar:Silver Star Story, SaGa Frontier 2, 
Legend of Mana, etc. Also great for making games like Hollow Knight, or point and click adventure games that use hand painted or complex
pixel art backgrounds.
